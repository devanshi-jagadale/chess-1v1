♟️ React Chess Game with Custom Chess Engine

A fully functional chess game built with React and a custom chess engine written entirely in JavaScript — no third-party chess libraries used.
The chess engine handles all move generation, legal move validation, check, checkmate, stalemate detection, castling rules, and pawn promotion.

🔥 Features

✅ Complete chess rule implementation:

Legal move generation

Check / checkmate detection
